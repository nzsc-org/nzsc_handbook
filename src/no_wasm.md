# No WebAssembly support
If you were directed to this page because you opened the web app and didn't see any text on your screen, it probably means you browser doesn't support WebAssembly by default.

If your browser offers WebAssembly support through an experimental flag, you should enable it. If you can't enable WebAssembly on your current browser, find a new browser.

WebAssembly is required to play NZSC on the web (because it is written in Rust).
