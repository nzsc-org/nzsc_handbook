# Rulebook

## 1. Setup
Each player begins with 0 points and 4 waits.

## 2. Choosing characters
Each player must simultaneously choose a unique character.
The list of characters can be found in [the reference](./reference.html#characters).

If multiple players choose the same character, all must repick.

A players cannot choose the same character more than 3 times in a row.

## 3. Choosing a booster
Each player must simultaneously choose a booster from their character, or choose No Booster.

A list of each character's boosters can be found in [the reference](./reference.html#boosters-of-each-character).

## 4. Move-choosing phase
Each player must simultaneously choose a move.

The initial set of moves a player can choose from will be the union of that player's [character's moves](./reference.html#moves-of-each-character) and that player's [booster's moves](./reference.html#moves-of-each-booster).

[Destructive moves](./reference.html#list-of-destructive-moves) will destroy every other move chosen on that turn.

[Single-use moves](./reference.html#list-of-single-use-moves) will destroy themselves when chosen.

Destroyed moves cannot be chosen.

A player cannot choose the same move more than 3 times in a row.

Each player scores a point for each opponent's move that the [outcome table](./reference.html#outcome-table-truth-table) dictates they get a point against.

The first player to reach 5 points wins the game.

## 5. Penalties
Choosing an illegal character, booster, or move will immediately nullify the turn.

The offending player will be penalized waits, as described in [the reference](./reference.html#penalties).

If a player's waits drops below 0, their waits will be set back to 0, and every opponent will score a point.

## 6. Tied Games
An NZSC game must only have 1 winner.

If multiple players have 5 or more points, subtract a point from every player's score until every player has 5 or less points. If there are still multiple players with 5 points, subtract a point from every player's score.
