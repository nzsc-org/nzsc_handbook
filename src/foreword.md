# Foreword

## What is NZSC?
NZSC is a simple hand game that a friend and I invented when we were in elementary school.

It is very similar to rock-paper-scissors, but a tad more complex.

## What is the purpose of this handbook?
This handbook is meant to serve as both
- a tutorial for newcomers who have never heard of NZSC in their life.
- a reference for veteran NZSC players.

If you came here to learn NZSC, get started with the [hands-on tutorial](./tutorial.html).
